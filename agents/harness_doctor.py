# Vendored from the Agent Harness Kernel.
#
#   source: agent-harness-kernel, branch `testing`, commit 5dee2cf
#   vendored: 2026-09-09
#
# It lives inside `agents/` rather than in the project's `scripts/` on purpose:
# the harness is meant to be copyable into another repository, and a harness
# that cannot check itself without its kernel is not portable. Copying
# `agents/` carries its own doctor.
#
# No kernel backup is kept in this repository (ADR 0001). The template
# adaptation check therefore needs `--kernel <path>` pointing at a fresh clone;
# every other check runs without one.
#
# Treat this file as vendored: fix it in the kernel and re-vendor, rather than
# editing it here, or the next upgrade silently discards the change.
"""Validate a mounted Agent Harness Kernel target.

This script checks the target project's active harness. It does not mount the
harness and it does not validate product correctness.

A green run is a STRUCTURAL check, not a truth check. It confirms that required
files exist, that cited paths resolve, and that local memory is really ignored.
It cannot confirm that what a document says is true, and must never be cited as
evidence that a document's claims are accurate.
